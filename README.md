This is a project from my full-stack engineering career path on codecademy.

Deep in his mountain-side meteorology lab, the mad scientist Kelvin has mastered weather prediction.
Now my code is basically all about converting Kelvin to Fahrenheits .

My code is not so perfect. Feel free to correct it where possible.
